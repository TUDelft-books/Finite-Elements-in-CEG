    "So far, you learned about the [Taylor series](./3-taylor-series.ipynb) that approximates a function using a sum of its derivatives. In this part, we will use the same expression but instead of estimating the function, we will use the known values of the function to estimate the derivatives. In doing so, we can convert the derivatives in a differential (partial) equation to algebraic expressions, which can then be solved more easily than a differential equation.\n",
