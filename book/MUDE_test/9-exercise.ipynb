    "# An Exercise for a Summary?\n",
    "\n",
    "After having gone through the Taylor series, forward and backward Euler, ODE solvers, iterative root finding methods and the stability of implicit and explicit systems, let’s take a look at a simple problem to bring these concepts into practice, all at once. This section shows you what a numerical code for solving differential equations looks like. The code itself is scalable for solving the most complicated differential equations in engineering such as the stress-strain equations, the Navier-Stokes equations and the Maxwell equations. \n",

    "Please go through this section while trying to write down everything on a piece of paper (to check how well you have understood the above-mentioned concepts). \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{y}=\\sin y^3 + \\sin t, \\hspace{10px} y(0)=1$$\n",

    "Let’s solve by extracting terms from the Taylor series expansions to obtain the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "\\text{Forward Euler: } y_{n+1}=y_n+\\Delta t(\\sin y_n^3 + \\sin t_n)\\\\\n",

    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, rewrite the above expressions in their residual forms to define a function $f$ such that the $f(y) = 0$, where $y$ is the root we are trying to find. \n",

    "$|f(y_{n+1})|<\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$ (or whatever you choose). The plots below have been generated using a Python code. Move the slider to change the value of the discrete time step, $\\Delta t$, to understand its influence on the accuracy and stability. \n"

    "In these answers, divergence/divergent solution stands for a solution that does not converge to a finite value. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The backward Euler guarantees a solution (not divergent) regardless of the time-step. This is due to its inherent stability.\n",
    "2. As the time-step increases, the forward Euler method starts running into instabilities. Initially, the instability is not large (mathematically) and the method produces a solution. As the time-step increases beyond this value, the solution starts diverging and will eventually approach infinity.\n",
    "3. The backward Euler remains accurate till a time-step of 0.3 but beyond that its accuracy reduces. The scheme nonetheless, remains stable. So its stability guarantees a solution that does not diverge but can be inaccurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that the inaccurate solution that backward Euler generates may appear to get closer to the original solution. This is purely a numerical artifact and is often noticed in numerical methods where a combination of an inaccurate guess, a large time-step and less accurate method may still produce a more accurate result, which is strongly influenced by the equation being solved and not necessarily the method. \n",
