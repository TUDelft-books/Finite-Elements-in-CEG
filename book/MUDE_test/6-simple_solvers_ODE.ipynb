    "## Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical stability deals with the impact of approximation errors introduced in simplifying a differential equation (in our case). A numerical method (or a solver) is stable if it does not magnify these truncation errors unboundedly as the computation proceeds. Mathematically, numerical stability can be defined with the following example.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = F(t_n, y_n, h)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation above, $F$ is the discretized form of the continuous equation $f$. The approximation is numerically stable if, for any initial condition $y_0$ and any time step size $h$, the error between the numerical solution and the true solution remains bounded as $n$ (the number of time steps) increases. In formal terms, there exists a real number $C$, independent of $n$, such that:\n",

    "Let’s consider a simple example. For $y(0) = 1$, the equation\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above equation, any $y_n$ is approximated as a function of $y_{n-1}$ by repeated application of the forward Euler scheme. You’ll notice that the relationship between $y_{n+1}$ and $y_0$ is an exponential function of $1-\\alpha h$. To prevent a ‘growth’ in the magnitude of the error, $1-\\alpha h$ should be less than 1, i.e.,\n",

    "In short, the explicit Forward Euler scheme is conditionally stable. The above condition must be satisfied (hence, it is a necessary condition) for numerical stability. What implication does this have for numerical solvers in general? It places an upper limit on the time-step that one can use.\n",

    "This also leads to the question: Are there schemes that are not accompanied by a stability criterion? Let’s repeat the above analysis with the Backward Euler scheme (implicit). One obtains\n",

    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n - \\alpha hy_{n+1} \\implies y_{n+1}(1+\\alpha h) = y_n$$\n",

    "\n",
