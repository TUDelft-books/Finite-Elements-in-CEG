Dhruv: For the coding assignment for week 1.6, I believe the students should be brought up to speed with calculating the mean, root mean square (e2), obtaining the absolute value, maximum and minimum value inside an array (e_infinity) and creating a log log plot with a detailed legend. I believe that should be enough? They should be able to use these to write the small portion of code for calculating these errors and filling in the table?
