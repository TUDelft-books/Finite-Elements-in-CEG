    "**Important things to retain from this block:**\n",
    "- Recognize the difference between single and multi-stage algorithms, single-step and multi-step algorithms (both implicit and explicit).\n",
    "- Understand that higher order (and implicit) methods are often more stable (you can use a wider range of timesteps) than lower order methods.\n",
    "- Always remember that stability is no guarantee of accuracy and convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward and forward Euler methods are the simplest methods for numerically solving differential equations. Letâ€™s start with a simple equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "y'(t) &= f(y,t) \\\\\n",
    "y(t_0) &= y_0\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can reformulate the above using Forward Euler (FE) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t f(y_n,t_n) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2) = F_{FE}(y_n,t_n) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "FE is a single-stage explicit algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mid-Point Quadrature\n",
    "\n",
    "FE can be improved further by estimating the function $f$ at the midpoint between $t_n$ and $t_{n+1}$ using what is known as the midpoint quadrature. One simply replaces the location where $f$ is used for the FE equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t f\\left(y_n+\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}f(y_n,t_n), t_n+\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2) = F_{RK2}(y_n,t_n) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, RK2 refers to the second-order Runge Kutta method, which is a single-step explicit method. FE and RK2 are exactly the same in construction but RK2 has a truncation error of the 3rd order, making it a 2nd order accurate method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More Stages, More Computational Time but More Accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4th order explicit Runge-Kutta (RK4) method has four stages, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6}(k_1+2k_2+2k_3+k_4) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^5) = F_{RK4}(y_n,t_n) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^5)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients $k$ are calculated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{cases}\n",
    "k_1 &= f(y_n,t_n) \\\\\n",
    "k_2 &= f(y_n+\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}k_1, t_n+\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}) \\\\\n",
    "k_3 &= f(y_n+\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}k_2, t_n+\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}) \\\\\n",

    "The figures above depict the steps involved in the FE and the RK4. As both methods are explicit, they will have to satisfy a stability criterion pertinent to the equation being solved. However, the RK4 used more points (stages) and hence, it is stabler for larger time-steps than the FE.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one requires both stability and accuracy at large time-steps, one must use an implicit formulation such as the implicit mid-point RK2 (Gauss-Legendre) or the Crank-Nicolson method. Can you think of what the equation for implicit RK2 looks like?\n",

    "## Multi-step or Multi-stage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-stage methods try to approximate the slope in multiple stages (like RK4 above) but are dependent only on one point $y_{n}$. A multi-step method uses multiple points for approximations i.e. $y_{n}, y_{n-1}$ and so on. One well-known example is the two-step Adams-Bashforth method that predicts the future values of $y$ at discrete time steps based on its previous values and the function $f(t, y)$. The formula for the 2-step Adams-Bashforth method is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2}\\left(3f(t_n, y_n) - f(t_{n-1}, y_{n-1})\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation predicts the future values of at discrete time steps based on its previous values and the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to multi-stage methods (such as RK4), multi-step methods are easier to implement, computationally more efficient and stabler, allowing the use of larger time steps and even adaptive time-stepping (changing the time step during the actual calculations to speed up or slow down the process). They also help conserve physical properties such as energy that are often not exactly conserved in a discrete setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, each method has its advantages and are generally employed based on a desired accuracy or computational efficiency. The choice, however, can often be complicated and requires thorough knowledge of the underlying mathematics.\n"
