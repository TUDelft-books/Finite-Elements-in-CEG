# 1.1. Introduction  

This online book offers an introduction to computational modelling using the finite element method (FEM). For this purpose, both linear and non-linear problems will be demonstrated. The FEM is a broadly used numerical tool that solves PDEs. The areas of application range from solid and structural mechanics to fluid mechanics. In recent years the application of such a method for solving complex physical phenomena end geometries is receiving more attention and is more frequently applied are it is bound with computational power. To be more specific, when a domain is discretised using FEM, a system of linear equations is built. Then, this matrix is solved numerically, using the available computational power.
