# 1.7. Isoparametric element in 1D

Isoparametric elements are used in finite element software. In this case shape functions are formed in a simple elemtn configuration (unit length side and width sides aligned with the coordinate system). 

The characteristic of an isoparametric element is that both geometry and displacement are interpolated using the same shape functions.
