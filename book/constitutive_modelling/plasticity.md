# Plasticity

## Overview
Elasto-plasticity is the study of materials that exhibit both elastic and plastic deformation. This chapter starts with the tangent stiffness matrix for FEM. Then various yield functions for plasticity will be covered, including their application in various materials. Then other important topics such as hardening/softening plasticity, additive decomposition and the flow rule are explained. Using this information the continuum tangent is derived. Loading conditions and multi-surface plasticity are also considered.

## Basic Equations for FEM
When using the Finite element method, we often make use of a system of equations. This is fundamental in the iterative process of solving finite element equations, ensuring that the external forces applied to the system are balanced by the internal forces generated due to the deformation induced by the current solution vector a.

$$
\mbf{K \Delta a} = \mbf{f_e} - \mbf{f_i} 
$$(p-l-displacement control)


### Tangent stiffnes matrix
If a tangent stiffness matrix is used, $\mbf{D_i}$ can be determined at integration point level with the following equation:

$$
\mbf{\Delta \sigma} = \mbf{D_i \Delta \varepsilon}
$$(p-l-D_i_local)

Using this information, the system can be assembled at a global level.

$$
\mbf{K} = \int_V \mbf{B^T D_i B} \ \ud V
$$(p-l-K)

### Stress update
The stresses can be calculated at integration point (local) level using Eq. {eq}`p-l-D_i_local` and Eq. {eq}`p-l-sigmadt`.

$$
\mbf{\sigma^{t+\Delta t}} = \mbf{\sigma^t + \Delta \sigma}
$$(p-l-sigmadt)

Furthermore, the internal force vector can be assembled at global level using:

$$
\mbf{f_i} = \int_V \mbf{B^T \sigma^{t+\Delta t}} \ \ud V
$$(p-l-forcevector)

The stiffness matrix $\mbf{D}$ is thus of great importance for elasto-plasticity. Further down, the continuum tangent matrix $\mbf{D_i}$ will be derived, but it is important to first tackle some additional theory required. Those ingredients for flow theory of plasticity are:
- Yield functions
- Hardening / softening law
- Flow Rule

```{Admonition} Remarks
Note that this theory is only valid if it satisfies the following conditions:
- Restrict to small strains
- Additive decomposition of strains
- Elastic unloading
```

## Yield Functions
Different materials have distinct yield functions:
- **Metals (pressure-independent, ductile):** Tresca, Von Mises, Gurson.
- **Soils (pressure-dependent, brittle):** Mohr-Coulomb, Drucker-Prager, Cam-clay.
- **Composites/Wood (anisotropic):** Hill, Hoffman, Tsai-Wu.
- **Concrete:** Rankine, Ottosen, Willam/Warnke.

### Mohr-Coulomb
The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is a model used in geotechnical engineering to predict material failure under shear stress. It states that failure occurs when the shear stress ($\tau$) on a plane reaches a critical value defined by {eq}`p-l-taucrit`.

$$
\mbf{\tau_{crit}} = \mbf{- \sigma \ tan(\phi)+c}
$$(p-l-taucrit)

where:
- c is the cohesion of the material (internal strength)
- $\sigma$ is the normal stress acting on the plane
- $\phi$ is the angle of internal friction (resistance to sliding)

This criterion helps engineers assess stability of structures like slopes and foundations. The following figure gives the critical envelope of Mohr-Coulomb.

```{figure} Images/mohr_coulomb_tau_sigma.png

Mohr-Coulomb
```

Eq. {eq}`p-l-taucrit` ca also be written as Eq. {eq}`p-l-taucrit2`, which will later be used to obtain the Mohr Coulomb yield function.

$$
\mbf{\tau_{crit}+\sigma \ tan(\phi)-c} = 0
$$(p-l-taucrit2)

Using trigonometry the critical envelope for Mohr-Coulomb in terms of principal stresses can be obtained.
```{Note}
It must hold that $\sigma_1 < \sigma_2 < \sigma_3$
``` 

```{figure} Images/mohr_coulomb_circle.png

Mohr circle
```

Expressions for the shear and normal stress are given in Eq. {eq}`p-l-shearstress` and Eq. {eq}`p-l-normalstress`, respectively.

$$
\mbf{\tau} = \mbf{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_3 - \sigma_1) cos{\phi}}
$$(p-l-shearstress)

$$
\mbf{\sigma} = \mbf{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 + \sigma_3 ) + \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_3 - \sigma_1) sin{\phi}}
$$(p-l-normalstress)

When substituting Eq. {eq}`p-l-shearstress` and Eq. {eq}`p-l-normalstress` into Eq. {eq}`p-l-taucrit2`, the following equation (Eq. {eq}`p-l-yieldfunction_1`) is derived:

$$
\mbf{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_3 - \sigma_1) + \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 + \sigma_3)sin(\phi)-c \ cos(\phi)} = 0
$$(p-l-yieldfunction_1)

This function written as a function of the stress in Eq. {eq}`p-l-yieldfunction_2`, is know as the $\textcolor{red}{\mbf{Mohr \ Coulomb \ yield \ function}}$.

$$
\textcolor{red}{\mbf{f(\sigma)} = \mbf{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_3 - \sigma_1) + \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 + \sigma_3)sin(\phi)-c \ cos(\phi)}}
$$(p-l-yieldfunction_2)

Using 6 permutations for $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$ and $\sigma_3$ Mohr-Coulomb can be defined. By using a state of uniaxial compression, meaning that $\sigma_3 = 0$ and $\sigma_2 = 0$, an equation for $\sigma_1$ can be derived.

$$
\mbf{\sigma_1} = \mbf{-\frac{2c \ cos(\phi)}{1-sin(\phi)}}
$$(p-l-sigma_1)

If the uniaxial compressive strength is defined as $\mbf{\sigma_1} = \mbf{f_c}$, the cohesion parameter can be 'measured' using the expression of {eq}`p-l-cohesion`.

$$
\mbf{c} = \mbf{\frac{1-sin(\phi)}{2 \ cos(\phi)}f_c}
$$(p-l-cohesion)

### Drucker Prager
The $\textcolor{red}{\mbf{Drucker-Prager \ yield \ function}}$ is a smooth approximation of Mohr-Coulomb, this means there are no corners.

$$
\textcolor{red}{\mbf{f(\sigma)} = \mbf{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}((\sigma_1 - \sigma_2)^2 + (\sigma_2 - \sigma_3)^2 + (\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)^2}) + \frac{1}{3}\alpha(\sigma_1 + \sigma_2 + \sigma_3) - k} = \mbf{\sqrt{J_2} + \alpha p - k}}
$$(p-l-druckerprageryield)

where:
- $\mbf{J_2}$ is the 2nd deviatoric stress invariant
- $\mbf{p}$ is the hydrostatic stress
- $\mbf{\alpha}$ and $\mbf{k}$ material constants

 Drucker-Prager coincides with 3 outer points of Mohr-Coulomb (in Ï€ -plane or two-dimensional principal stress space) if the conditions in {eq}`p-l-alpha` and {eq}`p-l-k` are met. This is illustrated in the figure below.

$$
\mbf{\alpha} = \mbf{\frac{6 sin(\phi)}{3 - sin(\phi)}}
$$(p-l-alpha)

$$
\mbf{k} = \mbf{\frac{6 c \ cos(\phi))}{3 - sin(\phi)}}
$$(p-l-k)

```{figure} Images/mohr_coulomb_drucker_prager.png
---
---
Mohr Coulomb and Drucker Prager
```

Both functions contain a point where $\mbf{\sigma_1} = \mbf{\sigma_2} = \mbf{\sigma_3}$, which is called the apex. Substitution of this property in the Mohr-Coulomb function gives $\mbf{\sigma_1} = \mbf{\sigma_2} = \mbf{\sigma_3} = \mbf{\frac{c \ cos(\phi)}{sin(\phi)}} = \mbf{c \ cot(\phi)}$. The apex is defined as $\mbf{(c \ cot(\phi), c \ cot(\phi), c \ cot(\phi))} = \mbf{a}$. The distance to the origin is $\mbf{|a|_2} = \mbf{\sqrt{a^T a}} = \mbf{\sqrt{3} \ c \ cot(\phi)}$.

### Tresca

The Tresca yield criterion, also known as the maximum shear stress criterion, is a material failure theory used in the field of solid mechanics. It predicts the onset of plastic deformation in ductile materials under complex loading conditions. This criterion is named after the French mechanical engineer Henri Tresca.

The Tresca yield criterion states that yielding begins when the maximum shear stress in a material reaches a critical value. This critical value is equivalent to the shear stress at yield in a simple tension test. Mathematically, the Tresca criterion can be expressed as in equation {eq}`p-l-tresca`, which can be rewritten as the Tresca yield function in {eq}`p-l-tresca_yield`.

$$
\mbf{\tau_{crit}} = \mbf{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)} = \mbf{c}
$$(p-l-tresca)

$$
\textcolor{red}{\mbf{f(\sigma)} = \mbf{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_3 - \sigma_1) - c}}
$$(p-l-tresca_yield)

Using 6 permutations for $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$ and $\sigma_3$, similar to Mohr-Coulomb, Tresca can be defined. By using a state of uniaxial compression, meaning that $\sigma_3 = 0$ and $\sigma_2 = 0$, an equation for $\sigma_1$ can be derived in {eq}`p-l-sigma_1_tresca`. If the uniaxial compressive strength is defined as $\mbf{\sigma_1} = \mbf{f_c}$, the cohesion parameter can be 'measured' using the expression of {eq}`p-l-cohesion_tresca`.

$$
\mbf{\sigma_1} = \mbf{2c}
$$(p-l-sigma_1_tresca)

$$
\mbf{c} = \mbf{\frac{1}{2}f_c}
$$(p-l-cohesion_tresca)

```

```{Admonition} Do you see that...
:class: tip
...Mohr-Coulomb with friction angle $\phi = 0$ gives Tresca
```

The Tresca yield criterion is widely used in engineering applications, particularly in designing components subjected to complex loading conditions, such as shafts, pressure vessels, and structural beams.

The Tresca yield criterion provides a straightforward approach to predicting the onset of plastic deformation in ductile materials based on the maximum shear stress. While less accurate than the von Mises criterion, its simplicity makes it a useful tool in many practical engineering scenarios.

### Von Mises
The Tresca criterion is often compared with the von Mises yield criterion, which is another common theory for predicting yielding in ductile materials. While the von Mises criterion assumes that yielding begins when the second deviatoric stress invariant reaches a critical value, the Tresca criterion is based on the maximum shear stress. Generally, the von Mises criterion is considered more accurate for predicting yielding in many materials, but the Tresca criterion is simpler and more conservative.

### Yield Surface Representation:
Graphical representations in different stress spaces are:
- 3D
- 2D
- Mohr circle
- Ï€-plane

```{dropdown} Ï€-Plane (Deviatoric Plane)
The Ï€-plane is a plane in the three-dimensional deviatoric stress space. It is orthogonal to the hydrostatic axis (the line where the stress states are purely hydrostatic, i.e., no deviatoric stress component). In this plane, the hydrostatic stress component is zero, and only the deviatoric stress components are considered.

#### Visualization

In the Ï€-plane:

- The coordinates are usually the principal deviatoric stresses \((s_1, s_2, s_3)\).
- The condition \(s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 0\) (because they are purely deviatoric) simplifies the representation to a two-dimensional plane.

#### Yield Surfaces on the Ï€-Plane

Yield functions define surfaces in stress space. When projected onto the Ï€-plane, these yield surfaces help visualize the material's yield behavior under different stress states:

- **Von Mises Yield Criterion**: In the Ï€-plane, this yield surface appears as a circle. This criterion assumes that yielding occurs when the second deviatoric stress invariant reaches a critical value, which corresponds to a circular shape in the Ï€-plane.
- **Tresca Yield Criterion**: This yield surface appears as a hexagon in the Ï€-plane. The Tresca criterion is based on the maximum shear stress theory, leading to a hexagonal shape when represented in the Ï€-plane.
- **Other Criteria**: Different materials and yield criteria will have different shapes in the Ï€-plane, such as ellipses or more complex polygons, depending on the material's specific yield characteristics.

#### Importance of the Ï€-Plane

- **Simplification**: The Ï€-plane provides a simplified, yet insightful view of the yield condition by focusing only on the deviatoric stresses.
- **Material Behavior**: Understanding how different materials yield under deviatoric stresses is crucial for designing components that can withstand specific loading conditions without permanent deformation.
- **Comparison**: It allows for an easier comparison of different yield criteria and their implications on material behavior under multi-axial loading conditions.

## Hardening/Softening Plasticity
### Hardening
- **Isotropic Hardening:** The yield surface expands uniformly.
- **Kinematic Hardening:** The yield surface translates in stress space.

### Softening
- The yield surface contracts, leading to material degradation.

## Flow Rules
### Associated Flow Rule
- The plastic potential function \( g \) is the same as the yield function \( f \).
- Ensures normality condition: \( \dot{\epsilon}^p = \lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial \sigma} \).

### Non-associated Flow Rule
- The plastic potential function \( g \) is different from the yield function \( f \).
- Provides better predictions for volume changes in certain materials like soils.

## Tangent Operator
- The consistent tangent operator \( D^t \) is used in numerical implementations to ensure quadratic convergence in Newton-Raphson iterations.

## Loading/Unloading Conditions
- Governed by Kuhn-Tucker conditions:
  \[
  f \leq 0, \quad \lambda \geq 0, \quad \lambda f = 0
  \]

## Multi-surface Plasticity
- Involves multiple yield surfaces or different loading conditions.
- The plastic strain rate is a linear combination of individual strain rates from each yield surface.
