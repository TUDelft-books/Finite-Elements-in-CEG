## Localisation

What is localisation of deformation?

Does a mathematical definition exist ? NO  
Represents loss of stability (material / structural) ? NO  
Represents loss of ellipticity (ill-posed boundary-value problem) ? NO

Experimental / computational observation: Small zones of intense straining occur (while remainder of body is unloading)
