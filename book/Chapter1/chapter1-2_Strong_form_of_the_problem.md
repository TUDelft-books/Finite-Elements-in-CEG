# 1.2. Strong form of the problem

Let's consider we need to describe a problem mathematically, meaning express the process taking place using symbols and equations. 
In order to have a complete descreption of the problem, one needs to formulate a well-posed set of the underlying differential equations with boundary conditions and in some cases also initial conditions. Solving the strong form of the problem leads to the exact solution of the continuous system. 

At this point, let's take as an example the one dimensional poisson equation to illustrate at first the so-called strong form of the problem. 


$$ -\nu \frac{\partial^{2} u}{{\partial x}^{2}} = f $$
