Gridap is a powerful library for finite element simulations, making it easy to set up and solve partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries.\n","\n","## Introduction\n","\n","In this particular example, we will consider a simple 1D bar subjected to heat conduction. The goal is to determine how temperature varies along the length of the bar over time. To achieve this, we will follow a structured workflow that covers problem formulation, model creation, finite element space setup, integration, weak form formulation, solver configuration, and the actual problem solution.\n","\n","## Workflow Overview\n","\n","Our workflow consists of the following steps:\n","\n","1. **Define the Problem**: Specify the problem parameters, including thermal conductivity and heat source.\n","\n","2. **Create a Discrete Model**: Define the domain (1D bar) and partition it into elements to create a discrete model that represents the bar's geometry.\n","\n","3. **Define Finite Element Space**: Select a suitable finite element type and create a finite element space for our simulation.\n","\n","4. **Set up Integration**: Specify the degree of quadrature for numerical integration and create a triangulation for our model.\n","\n","5. **Formulate the Weak Form**: Define the weak form of the heat conduction problem, expressing it in terms of finite element spaces and parameters.\n","\n","6. **Set up a Linear Solver**: Choose a nonlinear solver method (Newton's method) and create a finite element solver.\n","\n","7. **Solve the Problem**: Define the trial finite element space, construct the finite element operator, and solve the heat conduction problem.\n","\n","By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear understanding of how to set up and solve a simple 1D heat conduction problem using Gridap. You can then apply these principles to more complex simulations in your research or engineering projects.
