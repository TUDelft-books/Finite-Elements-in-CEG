# Videos: summary and additional material

The story of the derivation of the finite element method is told once more in this section with a series of videos.

:class: tip, dropdown
These videos overlap to some extent with the theory presented in the book. You do not need to be able to reproduce the 2D derivation from the third video. The fourth and fifth video complete the story of the finite element formulation for Poisson problems but go beyond what you will be expected to know at the exam.

### 2D derivation and boundary conditions

Derivation of the finite element method for the 2D Poisson equation. In the Friday project you will work with a 2D finite element implementation.

### Numerical integration

In the notebooks of this week, numerical integration is implemented in a rather direct way. This video presents a more general discussion of numerical integration for different elements.

### Isoparametric mapping

To complete the story of how shape functions and numerical integration are usually implemented in notebooks, here is a video with additional material on isoparametric mapping.
