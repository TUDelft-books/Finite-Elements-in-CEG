    "For this exercise we consider the same bar as in the preparation notebook. However, now the bar is elastically supported. An example of this would be a foundation pile in soil. The continuous spring constant is $k=100$ kN/m$^2$, all other parameters stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into the physics of this problem, we can describe it using the following differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -EA \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + ku = q $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional term with respect to the case without elastic support is the second term on the left hand side: $ku$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The finite element discretized version of this PDE can be obtained following the same steps as shown for the unsupported bar on the preparation notebook. Note that there are no derivatives in the $ku$ which means that integration by parts does not need to be applied on this term. The following expression is found for the discretized form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left[\\int \\mathbf{B}^T EA \\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{N}^T k \\mathbf{N} \\,dx\\right]\\mathbf{u} = \\int \\mathbf{N}^T q \\,d x + \\mathbf{N}^T h \\Bigg|_{x=L} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The only alteration from the procedure as implemented in the preparation notebook is the formulation of the stiffness matrix, which now consists of two terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{K} = \\int \\mathbf{B}^TEA\\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{N}^Tk\\mathbf{N}\\,dx $$\n",

    "\n",
    "As becomes clear, the second term in the integral of the element matrix depends on $x$. The introduction of a continuous spring delivers a quadratic term in the integral. Therefore it is not possible to calculate the integral by just taking the value in the middle and multiplying it by the length of the element. In this case we need to loop over a set of integration points to get an good approximation. \n",
