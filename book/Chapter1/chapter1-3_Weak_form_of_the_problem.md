# 1.3. Weak form of the Problem

The weak form of the problem is derived by multiplying the strong form by a weight function and then integrate by parts. In this manner, the order of derivatives appearing in the equations is reduced and the resulting equation facilitates a more convenient numerical solution.

As mentioned in the introduction, the finite element method, in contrast to the the finite difference method, is variational. This becomes more clear in this chapter, as the weak form of the equation is also known as the 'variational form' or 'variational equation'. Hence, the finite element method is a variational method, addressing the weak (variational) form of the corresponding governing equation.
