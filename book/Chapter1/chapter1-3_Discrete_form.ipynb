    "# The Discrete form\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the solution to the weak form {eq}`1drod_weak_final` derived in the [previous section](./chapter1-2_Weak_form_of_the_problem.md) is an infinite-dimensional problem, $u$ is unknown at every point $x$ in the domain and we also have an infinite number of possible weight functions $w$. In this section we will discretize the weak form such that it can be solved with a computer. With the aim to go from a continuous problem to a discrete problem, we approximate the solution by reducing the solution space to a finite number of unknowns and at the same time restricting the number of equation to a finite set.\n",

    "Let's introduce a finite set of **shape functions** (or interpolation functions) $N_i(x)$ with $i\\in[0,n-1]$, $n$ being the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs), and say that our approximate solution $u^h(x)$ is a linear combination of these shape functions:\n",

If we know the $u_i$ values for all $i$'s from 0 to $n-1$, using the interpolation defined in {eq}`interpolation`, we know $u^h$ for every $x$ in our domain. We are making an approximation here, it may be impossible to reconstruct the true solution $u(x)$ exactly with the simple shape functions $N_i(x)$, but it can be shown that if we increase the number of nodes, the true $u(x)$ will be approximated with increased accuracy. \n",
