The the Bernoulli - Euler Beam is valid for relatively slender beams, whereas the Timoshenko beam is relevant where shear deformations are present. In order to solve beam elements, a similar process is followed to the one used in continuum elements. Again, since the governing equation is formulated, a weak form of the equation must be developed. At this stage only in-plane, linear beams are considered. All forces and moments are in-plane. \n",
