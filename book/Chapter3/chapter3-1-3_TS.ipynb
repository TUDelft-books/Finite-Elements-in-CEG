    "This chapter presents the topic of shear locking. As seen in previous chapters, Timoshenko beam theory is valid for both short and slender beams. Conceptually, only a Timoshenko beam element would suffice for the analysis of both short and slender elements. This would be advantageous from a point of view of generality and simplicity as the Timoshenko beam uses $ C^0 $ shape functions.  However, when applying Timoshenko elements for thin, bending problems the results are influenced by the so-called **shear locking**. \n",

    "<b>Note:</b>  \n",
    "Shear locking is the effect that occues as a result of the finite element analysis, in which shear contribution to the energy does not vanish, resulting in an overly stiff response and bending displacements smaller than they should be. This practically means that the element cannot capture the kinematics of the deformation.\n",
