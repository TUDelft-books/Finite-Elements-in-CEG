    "This chapter presents the topic of shear locking. As seen in previous chapters, Timoshenko beam theory is valid for both short and slender beams. Conceptually, only a Timoshenko beam element would suffice for the analysis of both short and slender elements. This would be advantageous from a point of view of generality and simplicity as the Timoshenko beam uses $ C^0 $ shape functions.  However, when applying Timoshenko elements for thin, bending problems the results are influenced by the so-called **shear locking**. \n",
