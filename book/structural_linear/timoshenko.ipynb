    "The Timoshenko beam allows shear deformation and is valid for slender as well as for relatively short beams. In Timoshenko beam theory, planes normal to the beam axis remain plain but do not necessarily remain normal to the longitudinal axis. The rotation of the normal to the beam axis $\\theta$ is not directly coupled to the first derivative of the deflection $\\frac{dw}{dx}$. This assumption allows for shear deformation, where the shear strain $\\gamma$ is a measure for how much the \n",

In Timoshenko beam theory, however this is not the case. Shear deformation can be unequal to zero, and as a consequence $w$ and $\\theta$ are independent fields.

    "This chapter presents the topic of shear locking. As seen in previous chapters, Timoshenko beam theory is valid for both short and slender beams. Conceptually, only a Timoshenko beam element would suffice for the analysis of both short and slender elements. This would be advantageous from a point of view of generality and simplicity as the Timoshenko beam uses $ C^0 $ shape functions.  However, when applying Timoshenko elements for thin, bending problems the results are influenced by the so-called **shear locking**. \n",
