    "The Timoshenko beam allows shear deformation and is valid for slender as well as for relatively short beams. In Timoshenko beam theory, planes normal to the beam axis remain plain but do not necessarily remain normal to the longitudinal axis. In other words, the rotation of the normal to the beam axis $\\theta$ is not directly coupled to the first derivative of the deflection $\\frac{dw}{dx}$. This assumption allows for shear deformation, where the shear strain $\\gamma$ is a measure for how much the rotation of the plane normal to the beam axis with respect to the rotation of the beam axis itself. This is the first **kinematic relation** in Timoshenko beam theory: \n",
