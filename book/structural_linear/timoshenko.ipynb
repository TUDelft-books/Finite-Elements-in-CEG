    "The Timoshenko beam allows shear deformation and is valid for slender as well as for relatively short beams. In Timoshenko beam theory, planes normal to the beam axis remain plain but do not necessarily remain normal to the longitudinal axis. In other words, the rotation of the normal to the beam axis $\\theta$ is not directly coupled to the first derivative of the deflection $\\frac{dw}{dx}$. This assumption allows for shear deformation, where the shear strain $\\gamma$ is a measure for how much the rotation of the plane normal to the beam axis with respect to the rotation of the beam axis itself. This is the first **kinematic relation** in Timoshenko beam theory: \n",

    "\n",
    "Since there are no forces acting on our beam except at the end of the cantilever beam, the creation of the element force matrix is very easy. It is just a vector of length 4 with zeros.\n",

    "Adding all element force matrices will give a vector of zeros with a length of twice the number of nodes (e.g. 3 elements, will require 4 nodes, so 8 zeros). This is initialized in the `simulate` function below. The last step is adding the boundary condition caused by the shear force ($F_y$) at the end cantilever beam by changing the last element of the global matrix $\\textbf{f}$ to $F_y$.\n",

    "We have now derived the relation between $\\textbf{a}$ and $\\textbf{f}$ through matrix $\\textbf{K}$. However, when we try to solve the equation, we will run again into a problem. This is the fact that the first two entries of $\\textbf{a}$; $\\theta_1$ and $w_1$ are 0. A way to overcome this problem is to eliminate equations belonging to nodes for which the solution is known. As long as the prescribed degrees of freedom have a value of 0 (i.e. homogeneous Dirichlet conditions), we can do this by simply removing the corresponding columns and rows out of our system. This is in similar fashion as in [Finite element implementation](.\\.\\introduction\\matrix.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `simulate` returns the solution of the problem given the number of discrete elements and the integration scheme. At this point we also need to give numbers to the parameters of the problem. We will use $L=10$ $m$, $EI=2 \\cdot 10^4$ $N/m^2$, $GA_s=1 \\cdot 10^5$ $N$ and $F_y=1$ $N$. Note that at the end we add the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions back to our output for $\\textbf{a}$ (those are $\\theta_1$ and $w_1$, which both are 0)."
