## Paraview basics

### Load the data
Before proceeding with the visualisation of data in Paraview, the first step is to load the dataset. Paraview supports a broad range of file formats, including `.VTU`, `.VTK`, `.CSV`, `.NetCDF`, and others. Among these, `.VTU` and `.VTK` are the most commonly used file formats, as they can store both the geometry and associated data (such as scalar, vector, or tensor fields).

The key distinction between `.VTU` and `.VTK` files lies in the type of data they represent. A `.VTU` file typically contains data for a single snapshot or time step, while a `.VTK` file can store multiple datasets or "situations" of data. For example, in the case of a time-dependent simulation, each `.VTU` file represents the solution at one specific time step. When all the `.VTU` files (corresponding to different time steps) are combined, they can be converted into a single `.VTK` file. This transformation allows the visualisation of the solution over time, enabling dynamic exploration of time-varying data.

To load your data:

1. Navigate to `File > Open` and select the file you wish to load. Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the file into the Paraview interface. _Hint_: When importing a series of `.VTU` files with logically numbered filenames, Paraview will automatically combine them into a single `.VTK` file for easier visualisation.
2. Once the file is loaded, the dataset will appear in the **Pipeline Browser** on the left side of the screen. From here, you can start applying filters and visualisations. The Pipeline Browser is an essential part of Paraview, displaying the structure of your current visualisation pipeline. It provides a hierarchical view of all the data sources, filters, and visual elements that make up your visualisation workflow. Each entry in the Pipeline Browser corresponds to a dataset (e.g., a `.VTU` or `.VTK` file), a filter (e.g., a clip or contour filter), or a rendering element (e.g., a 3D view of the data).
   
   To view and modify the properties of any selected data or filter, simply click on it in the Pipeline Browser. The selected item will be highlighted, and its properties will be displayed in the **Properties Panel** below. This panel shows a range of configurable options and attributes for the selected item, allowing for detailed adjustments. For example, we can extract element blocks, nodesets and variables. The properties panel is shown in figure XX below.

4. To render the selected data or filter to your visualisation, click the **Apply** button in the Properties Panel.

### Scientific visualisation with coloring

In scientific visualisation, coloring plays a key role in representing data values in a way that enhances understanding and highlights important features. Paraview provides powerful tools for adjusting color maps, setting data value ranges, applying transparency, and displaying color bar legends. Below are some key techniques to customize the appearance of your visualisations:

1. **Setting Data Value Range (or Automatic Rescaling)**  
   Setting an appropriate data value range ensures that the color map accurately reflects the data's range. You can either manually set the data range or let Paraview automatically rescale the color map based on the datasetâ€™s values.  
   - Select the dataset or filter in the Pipeline Browser.
   - In the Properties Panel, under the **Color Map** section, set the **Data Range** to display the scalar values you are interested in.
   - If enabled, **Automatic Rescaling** adjusts the color map range automatically to fit the minimum and maximum values of the dataset.

2. **Changing Color Maps**  
   The color map used in the visualisation is critical for interpreting scalar values. Paraview provides various built-in color maps that can be applied based on the type of data being visualised. To change the color map:
   - Select the dataset or filter you want to visualise.
   - In the Properties Panel, under the **Display** section, click **Edit Color Map** (found in the **Coloring** drop-down menu).
   - You can choose from various predefined color maps like **Cool to Warm**, **Rainbow**, **Jet**, or customize a color map to better represent your data.

3. **Apply Transparency to Colors**  
   Transparency allows you to visualise the interior of objects or to better see overlapping structures in your dataset. To apply transparency:
   - Select the dataset in the Pipeline Browser.
   - In the Properties Panel, under the **Display** section, adjust the **Opacity** slider. The opacity can be set uniformly for the entire dataset or based on data values, allowing for more flexible visualisations.

4. **Show and Edit Color Bar Legend**  
   The color bar legend is an important visual element that shows the relationship between the data values and the colors in the visualisation. To display and customize the color bar legend:
   - After selecting a dataset and applying a color map, right-click on the 3D view window and select **Show Color Legend**.
   - You can further customize the color bar by selecting it and adjusting its properties through the **Color Legend Editor**. This editor allows you to change the position, size, orientation, and labeling of the color bar to match your visualisation style and improve readability.
   
### Augmented reality

The great thing about Paraview is that there is not only coloring to visualise the data. Here, we describe 4 other common used visualisation tools in Paraview: Contour, Glyph, Stream Tracer and Warp by Vector.

#### Contour
  
The **Contour** filter is used to create contour lines or surfaces that represent regions of constant scalar values within a dataset. It's particularly useful for visualising scalar fields (such as temperature, pressure, or concentration). The contour surfaces provide insight into the distribution of scalar values and help identify key features, such as boundaries or transitions in the data. We can apply the filter from the **Filters** menu (`Filters > Alphabetical > Contour`). In the Properties Panel, specify the contour levels (scalar values) to visualise.

#### Glyph

The **Glyph** filter is used to visualise vector fields (e.g., velocity, magnetic fields) by placing geometric shapes (called glyphs) at points in the dataset, scaled according to the vector magnitude. This helps in visualising the direction and strength of the vector field, often used in fluid dynamics or other simulations involving vector data. We can apply the **Glyph** filter from the filter menu (`Filters > Alphabetical > Glyph`). In the Properties Panel, choose the vector field to visualise and select the glyph shape (e.g., arrow). Adjust the **Scale Factor** to control the size of the glyphs.

#### Stream Tracer
 
The **Stream Tracer** filter is used to generate streamlines (or stream tubes) from a vector field. Streamlines represent the flow paths that particles would follow in a vector field (such as fluid flow). This tool is commonly used in fluid dynamics to visualise the flow of fluids or gases. Apply the **Stream Tracer** filter from the filter menu (`Filters > Alphabetical > Stream Tracer`). In the Properties Panel, specify the **Seed Points** (initial points from which the streamlines will begin) and adjust the **Integration Method** and **Step Size** to control the trace accuracy.

#### Warp by Vector
 
The **Warp by Vector** filter deforms the geometry of a dataset based on a vector field. It "warps" the data by shifting its points along the vectors, effectively distorting the shape of the dataset to visualise how the vector field is affecting the structure. Apply the **Warp by Vector** filter from the filter menu (`Filters > Alphabetical > Warp By Vector`). In the Properties Panel, choose the vector field to use for the warping and set the **Scale Factor** to control the magnitude of the warp.
