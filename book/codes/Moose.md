# Moose

Moose (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment) is a computational framework designed for solving complex multiphysics problems using the finite element method (FEM). It provides a flexible platform that allows users to create custom simulations by writing input files and extending its capabilities with C++ code. Moose is particularly powerful for simulating multiphysics problems. The core of Moose is written in C++, but it allows users to interact through both input files and Python scripts for automation and post-processing. The framework includes many pre-built modules for common multiphysics problems, but users can also add custom physics models, solvers, and material behaviors. Moose supports parallel computation, making it suitable for large-scale simulations on high-performance computing systems. The platformâ€™s modular design allows for easy integration with other software tools and solvers. For users with minimal programming experience, Moose provides a high-level interface to set up and solve simulations without the need for extensive coding. However, advanced users can extend the framework by writing custom code to implement new solvers or physics models. Moose is widely used in research and industry for solving multiphysics problems that require accurate, efficient, and scalable simulations.
