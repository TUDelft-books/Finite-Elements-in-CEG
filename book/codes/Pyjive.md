# Pyjive

Pyjive is a finite element library in python. It is inspired by the **jive** C++ library developed that is used for research in the Computational Mechanics group. 

This book contains a collection of workshops in which pyjive is used to perform finite element analysis on various problems and to illustrate how theory from the book can be translated to functioning code.
