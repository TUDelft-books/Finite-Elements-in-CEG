# Pyjive

Pyjive is a finite element library in python. It is inspired by the **jive** C++ library developed that is used for research in the Computational Mechanics group. 

This book contains a collection of workshops in which pyjive is used to perform finite element analysis on various problems and to illustrate how theory from the book can be translated to functioning code.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Pyjive makes extensive use of **classes** and **objects**. A class is a collection of funtions and variables, and an object in an instance of that class. For a quick overview of classes in Python, watch [this video](https://youtu.be/yYALsys-P_w?si=XBR0wnbVbpl8vu-Y).
